On the Youtube channel [The Thought Emporium](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjClTnZ4Xh4), I learned that you can use software defined radio to receive weather sattelite image. I didn't think about trying it out myself until recently (Spring 2020), when I suddenly found myself with quite a bit of free time.

I ordered an [RTL-SDR USB dongle](https://www.rtl-sdr.com/buy-rtl-sdr-dvb-t-dongles/) with a basic dipole antenna kit and started experimenting.
