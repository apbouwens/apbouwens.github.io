In the previous post I talked about how I was mesmerized by the beautiful images radioed down to earth by the NOAA satellites. These use the APT system, which dates back to the 1960s. So clearly, there should be room for improvement.

Indeed there is, but there's just one lonely satellite sending down higher resolution images in the easy 137 MHz range: the Russian Meteor M-2.
