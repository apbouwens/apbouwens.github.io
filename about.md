I'm an optical systems engineer working at [Lambda-X](https://www.lambda-x.com/en). Having a bit more time on my hands these days, I started this blog as a diary about my attempts to fully understand how satellite data is transmitted to Earth.

### More Information

In the past I did research in the field of optical microscopy. Here's a [list of my publications](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Arno_Bouwens).
